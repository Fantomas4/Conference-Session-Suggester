# Conference-Session-Suggester
A project from my 6th semester in the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
I was given the task of developing an application in SWI-Prolog that would suggest the most interesting sessions available
at a Technology Conference to the user, based on keywords the user provided.
